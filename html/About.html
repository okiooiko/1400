            <h2><i class="fa fa-id-card-o"></i> Information about Springbrook National Park</h2>
            <p >
                    Springbrook National Park (Springbrook National Park) is one of the national parks in eastern Australia, located about 78 kilometers south of Brisbane,
                 Queensland, and is part of Australia's World Heritage "East Coast Rainforest Reserve".<br>
                 In December 1994, the United Nations World Heritage Association officially expanded the area to include Springbrook National Park, Mt Barney, and the North New South Wales Rainforest.
                 <br>
                 Springbrook National Park is divided into three major areas, namely Springbrook Plateau, Natural Bridge area and The Cougals area. The cliffs are 
                geologically special and are also part of the (Lamington National Park) of the Remington National Park, which is part of the northern edge of the 
                Australian volcanic terrain and is very steep.
                <br>
                Spring Creek National Park is most famous for the natural bridge area with "blue worms", where natural caves are formed due to water erosion, and the shape is similar to a bridge, so it is called a natural bridge. Watching fireflies at night is the main a
                ctivity of the Natural Bridge. Fireflies only inhabit parts of Australia and New Zealand.
                The best time to visit Springbrook National Park is from May to October each year. It's home to shade creepers, palms, eucalyptus, canyons, cliffs, waterfalls, 
                and some pretty good hiking trails.
                <br>
            </p>
            <h2><i class='fas fa-exclamation-circle'></i> Looking after the Park </h2>
            <p>
                The natural beauty of Springbrook National Park attracts thousands of people to the area and high 
                visitor numbers create many pressures. Litter, erosion caused by shortcutting tracks, damage to vegetation 
                and disturbance to wildlife all threaten nature's delicate balance.
                <br>
                You can help protect the park by observing these guidelines:<br> <br>
                (1)Leave all plants and animals undisturbed.<br> <br>
                (2)Do not feed or leave scraps for wildlife. Feeding native animals can cause them to become reliant on the food source, 
                suffer from disease or over-populate to an extent that they dominate an area and aggressively exclude other wildlife. 
                Animals that are fed can become aggressive to humans. On the spot fines apply.<br> <br>
                (3)Scatter washing water well away from waterways. Bring non-greasy foods so dishes can be cleaned without detergent. 
                Never use soaps or detergents in creeks as they pollute the waterways and promote unnatural algal growth. On the spot fines apply.<br> <br>
                (4)Use toilets if available. Away from toilets, ensure all faecal matter and toilet paper is properly buried (15cm deep) well away from tracks, 
                campsites, watercourses and drainage channels (100m). Carry out disposable nappies and sanitary and hygiene products.<br> <br>
                (5)Take your rubbish home. Minimal impact bushwalkers take great care to avoid leaving any rubbish. Remember—pack it in, pack it out. 
                Waste transfer stations are located on Carricks Road, Springbrook and 300m north of the Numinbah Valley township.<br> <br>
                (6)Keep to the walking tracks where provided, don't shortcut, and take care near cliff edges.<br><br><br><br>
